    This checks for keys that are currently being held, whether or not they've actually been pressed recently.
    This is used, for example, to transition from a landing state into a running one. Using the InputBuffer
    would mean that you'd either need to iterate over the WHOLE buffer and look for one less release than press,
    or limit yourself to having to press the button before landing, whether you were moving in the air or not.
    If you are looking for a button PRESS, use bufferContains. If you are looking for IF A KEY IS STILL BEING HELD,
    this is your function.
